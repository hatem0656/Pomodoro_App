## My process

### Built with

- HTMl & CSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Redux (Redux toolkit)](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - For State Management

### What I learned

It was a challenge to make the circular timer indicator using canvas (canvas path methods) although there other libraries that would have make it much easier for me but I was happy to make the logic by myself

Moreover, This is my fifth project developed using React Library, and I focus my attention on component's architecture and state management.
Considering the simplicity of state in this kind of App, I opted for Redux Tookit.

At the end, I wanted to expand my knowledge of Styled Components Library, so I used this project to learn how to use a globalStyles in the app, as well as styled-components with props and animation.

### Continued development

I want to learn how to write cleaner code with perfect reusable and testable components. This is not something you learn on tutorials, because often they are way simplier compared to real project. You can learn it only by doing.
